        <p>Emory's Past</p>
            <p>Emory used a young girl with a rough life. they had a family who didn't care for them much, often leaving them for dead. emory was the "frail girl".
            Their parents argued, so they'd go to the forest near to escape. the forest was forbidden to the public. rumors spoke that the forest was alive, and that if anyone were dare to enter, it'd kill on the spot. the foundation later found this true, never making it public. while the forest was alive and dangerous, it had a soft spot for emory. it protected them.</p>
            <p>As emory grew, just like their relationship with the forest. relationship with their family worsened. when emory was 14, they punched a tree within the forest from anger. this made the forest upset, and the forest attempted to kill them.
            They ran into anomaly 888, which swallowed them and made emory its host. emory lost most of their memory, and soon the foundation found them. now emory is a residing anomaly.</p>
            <br>
