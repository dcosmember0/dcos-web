Team twelve, do you copy?
TEAM 12: Loud and clear, what's the problem?
Anomaly CA-009 is suspected to be taken from site Foxtrot on the 12th of June. We are going to need extra guards on site.
TEAM 12: No can do! We got a problem of our own as of right now. There is already stuff going on at site one that is causing chaos.
Then what do you sugest?
TEAM 12: Just evacuate the place. That's the best bet we have.
Ok. should we leave the anomalies?
TEAM 12: I would check with Proot on that one.
Got it. Over and out.
