            <p>Class: &Alpha;</p>
            <p>Type: Illusion</p>

            <br>
            <p>Anomaly CA-002 is simmilar to CA-004 and NC-001, but instead of illusions of voices from people you know leading you into a trap or seeing eyes on every object you look at, you see a person that has died from a Not Contained Anomaly and are trying to bring you somewhere. If they succeed with bringing you into a room where nobody else can see you, they will reshape into a anomaly known as a Voidshift*. Not too long after, you will have passed out and murdered by the anomaly, leaving your body hidden.</p>

            *Voidshifts are creatures that have the ability to shapeshift in dark areas, but when a light source is shining onto them, they go back to their origional form.
