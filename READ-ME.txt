This website is all based off of a creation that i made about 2 years ago to tie lore onto some drawings i made in my free time. NONE of these "anomalies" are actually real (except for The eyes, or NC-001). And yes, the website is supposed to look buggy. If you have any questions, just ask me.

If you are reading this, please know that I know this isn't what the rubric for the assignment asks for, but I thought that this would be enough to show that I know what we have gone over in web design. Some things in the css I learned on my own or from online sources, but most of it is from the class. Also this website isn't completely done yet, and probably will never be until i run out of storage space, but this is the jist of it all. Like i said before, If you have any questions, just ask me.

Make sure you go to START.html and then Home/DCOS.html
