This website is all based off of a creation that i made about 2 years ago to tie lore onto some drawings i made in my free time. NONE of these "anomalies" are actually real (except for The eyes, or NC-001). And yes, the website is supposed to look somewhat buggy. If you have any questions, just ask me.

If you are reading this, please know that this website isn't completely done yet, and probably will never be until i run out of storage space, but this is the jist of it all. Like i said before, If you have any questions, just ask me.

Make sure you go to start2.html and then index2.html
