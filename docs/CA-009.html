            <p>Anomaly CA-009 Used to be a test subject for the D.C.O.S. until a certain test made him who he is now. Before the attack on Site Foxtrot, he was put in a solitary confinement cell. When they checked on him, he was unconscious sitting in the corner. There was antimatter spreading like vines on the walls around him. The rest of the info is removed due to classified info.</p>
            <p>He Can create any weapon he puts to thought or has seen before, as long as he has enough materials stored in his hammerspace to do so.</p>
