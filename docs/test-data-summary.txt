[8/21/2025] These demons weren't a product of some kind of experiment, there a product of our sins.
When a person's mind and soul are without the protection of God, either from need for repenting, or the light fully being smothered out of their soul, A form of God's wrath consumes the person.
If this event happens at the same time as a spiritual shift of alignment, then they corrupt and become a "demon" of reformed power.
This event can also happen if the person's mind shatters and their soul burns out.
A person's mind can shatter in a handful of ways, but the few that break by finding out a celestial truth or by seeing a true-form astral being can form into higher power "demons".
