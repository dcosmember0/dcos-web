        <p>These are more older anomalies that were form the wiki page. These are not fully lore accurate for the most part. I will try to update them every once in a while.</p>

        <p>001-006</p>
        <p>GOD'S EVIL SONS</p>
        <p>Containment protocols: N/A</p>
        <p>Location of anomalous objects: THE VOID</p>
        <p>Harm status: 97</p>
        <p>Description:
             001-006 are god-like beings floating through empty areas in the Omniverse. These entities have been seen on multiple areas of war, nuclear test sites, experimental zones, asylums, and prisons. From what we know, these anomalies were insane, went to jail 9 times, were locked in a mental asylum, escaped, injured in a nuclear test site, then experimented on because of muotatins unknown reasons. These experiments made them able to phase out of our reality and into others.</p>
        <p>DO NOT LOOK AT THEM; if you do, prepare for death.</p>

        <p>Description: 
            Anomaly 007 is a humanoid figure with his legs ripped off. The anomaly has the ability to levitate up to 27 feet off the ground. Its bottom left hand has five knives circling around in a perfect circle. These knives can be thrown at a speed of 26 kilometers per minute without much force. His upper left and right hand are a black substance. There is a hole in the anomaly's chest filled in by the same black substance.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Anomaly 008 is a multi-material statue, made of mostly limestone. The joints are copper wire 7 inches thick. His joints can extend to any given length the entity wants. There are 5 joints in his neck, 3 joints in the right arm, 2 joints in the left arm, and 3 joints in his left and right leg. Its eye has a dark purple liquid dripping from it.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Anomaly 009 is a cyborg-like entity that has 4 spear arms like the ones on 007. His right leg has wires holding metal pieces of his leg that were broken off of him. There is an engraving on his back with this, {∞}. His “mouth” can shatter to form a hole with a robotic hand. This robotic hand can extend and grab any nearby electronic or living thing.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Anomaly 010 is a humanoid being that has a body of mostly flesh, bone of multiple carbon dates, and the same black goo-like substance seen on multiple other anomalies. His left hand is a hook made of this goo, and so is his 3 fingered claw on his right hand. Instead of having legs,it has the black substance that moves like a sentient organism. It has one horn that has cracked through his skull and left marks on his head. His left eye is stitched shut while his right eye is gone and leaks a dark purple substance called “Void matter”. He is always smiling…</p>
