This website is all based off of a creation that i made about 2 years ago to tie lore onto some drawings i made in my free time. NONE of these "anomalies" are actually real (except for The eyes, or NC-001). And yes, the website is supposed to look buggy (once I fully fix it). If you have any questions, just ask me.

Make sure you go to START.html and then index.html if you downloaded it. If you want to use some of my website as a template, please ask.
