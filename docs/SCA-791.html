            <p>Causes: Kaines first life was ended in the *incident*. Afterwards he was reborn and found by lead researchers Tony and Voidlen, who took him in as a sort of half research project, half adoption. Ranos origins however, are completely unknown.</p>

            <p>Anomaly SCA-791 is a shared body, two minds. One side is a sweet child, looking to be around 14. Despite his childish and innocent appearance. He is known to be the direct reincarnation of the Demigod of Dreams. The other side, is named Rano. An always tired but obedient child, around 15. Rano moves from person to person, working as a butler, which is suited to him from his obedience and natural talent .</p>
