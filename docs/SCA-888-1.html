        <p>Emory's Past</p>
            <p>Emory used a young girl with a rough life. they had a family who didn't care for them much, often leaving them for dead. emory was the "frail girl".
            Their parents argued, so they'd go to the forest near to escape. the forest was forbidden to the public. rumors spoke that the forest was alive, and that if anyone were dare to enter, it'd kill on the spot. the foundation later found this true, never making it public. while the forest was alive and dangerous, it had a soft spot for emory. it protected them.</p>
            <p>As emory grew, just like their relationship with the forest. relationship with their family worsened. when emory was 14, they punched a tree within the forest from anger. this made the forest upset, and the forest attempted to kill them.
            They ran into anomaly 888, which swallowed them and made emory its host. emory lost most of their memory, and soon the foundation found them. now emory is a residing anomaly.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Anomoly 888
            a mushroom that leaks of ink. blends in with the inky cap mushroom to hide. if seen fit, its ink with attach to a host. this host will become swallowed by the anomoly, losing memory. it may choose to leave its host, only if seen fit.</p>
            
            <p>Important Information</p>
            <p>Danger Threat : 4/10. Lashes out if upset. due to the emotions they had when coming in contact with anomaly 888.</p>
            <p>Tends to leak ink, like an inky cap mushroom. the more ink, the higher their anxiety.
            From memory loss, they realized being called a female was unfitting. so they identify as nonbinary, using they/them pronouns.</p>
            
            <p>Emory's Personality</p>
            <p>Emory tends to be shy and reserved, but is very curious and stubborn. they ask many questions, and tend to mumble under stress.</p>
            <p>They pick up on things and learn very quickly.</p>
            <p>Strengh can be significant, but they are yet to know. any lashes of anger can have result in signs of their strengh, but nothing important has shown.</p>
